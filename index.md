#### Day 2: Round Tables + Workshop Dinner
**9:00 -- 16:00: Round tables** (Coffee and lunch breaks will be announced spontaneously)

*A tandem moderation (natural scientist + archaeologist) of all round tables is envisaged.* 

**Round table 1**: Which data and meta-information is crucial?

* I. Villa (Bern): Pb from the millimeter to the planet: what else is usually forgotten? -- Introductory talk
* Topics: 
  a. Analytical data
  b. Geological materials
  c. Artefacts -- and which ones are suitable as reference data? 
  d. By-products (e.g., slags, prills, ores from excavation sites)
  
**Round table 2**: Standardization of databases 

* K. Elger (Potsdam): t.b.a. -- Introductory talk
* Topics: 
  a. Interconnectivity between different databases: Each group deploys their own data online and develops an API to link other databases. Alternatively, each contributes data to a central database (like GlobaLID) so that all data can be accessed at once? 
  b. Unique resource identifier (URI) and controlled vocabularies and terminologies; Adoption of unique identifiers, such as the IGSN for samples. Use of thesauri, ontologies, standardized mineral abbreviations, geological period information from e.g., USGS, EarthChem databases; geological time periods vs. orogenic events.
  
**Round table 3**: Statistics and visualization  

* P. Degryse (Leiden/Leuven): Perspectives on data dots, biplots, ellipses and model ages -- Introductory talk
* Topics: 
  a. Visualization, statistic and processing tools, methods -- what is really useful and needed by the community? What is required, what would be nice-to-have? 
  b. Reporting -- What is proper reporting?
  
**Evening: Workshop dinner** (details will follow soon)

#### Day 3: Plenaries + Round tables

**9:00--13:00**: Morning session

* Impulse talk by Chr. Keller (Berlin): t.b.a.
* Presentation of the round table discussions and discussion of their results
* *Short coffee break*
* Return to the round tables: Define the discussed standards, taking into account the feedback from the plenary

**13:00**: *Lunch break*

**14:30 -- 16:00**: Afternoon session, final plenary

* Summary of the second round of round tables
* Discussion about how to proceed, e.g., 
  - Follow-up meetings
  - Roadmap to the publication and establishment of the community standard
  - Extension to other methods and materials
  
**16:00**: Closing of the workshop, take-aways and farewell
